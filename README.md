## Demo Project

### Background
Linda is a distance swimmer. Each month, she buys a lap swim pass from the city Department of 
Parks and Recreation that gets her 20 entries to the pool and is only good for one month. 

The current cost of the pass is $50.

The first time she swims each month, she swims 1 kilometer (1000 meters). She increases her distance by 100 
meters each time she swims during the month

Build an app that will tell Linda:
- How far she will have swum if she swims 20 times
- What is her price per kilometer swum
- What do the numbers look like if any of the variables in the equation change:
-- Price for the lap swim pass
-- Number of times she uses the pass in a month
-- Starting distance
-- Daily increase in distance
